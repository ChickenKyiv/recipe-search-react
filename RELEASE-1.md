Release #1
Heading: Form, connected with our search API.
SubHeading: GET + POST queries. Displaying search results.
Summary: In order to make our form working with our server -> we should connect frontend + backend.
Problem: our search server is partly completed, but not tested and don't have a frontend part.
Solution: create a list of basic API endpoints and send data from form fields into our server.

Display json results in our front page.

How to get started:
- `clone current repo`
- `clone server API repo`
call URL/explorer in order to see all endpoints that we have inside.

Customer Quote: With this form and data from the server we were able to reduce the time of coding.

Closing: Setup this developer version and save the time of your developers.
